            This capstone project for my Computer Systems course involved a talented, multidisciplinary team comprising two electrical engineers, two software engineers, and three computer systems engineers. Together, we designed and developed a smart scale system specifically tailored for dogs. The system includes a scale equipped with a PCB housing weight sensors and signal conditioning. This PCB is connected to the Raspberry Pi Pico W, which efficiently handles tasks such as signal conversion, taring, stabilization, and power management. The weight data is then transmitted to the MERN stack frontend/backend, where it is displayed and logged on a web application.            </p>
            <p>
            I worked on the embedded software, specifically programming the Raspberry Pi Pico W, as well as the UX design and frontend development. Collaborating with such a diverse team was an incredible experience, and I made wonderful friends along the way!

              We developed a user-friendly GUI program in Python to make it easy to work with handwritten letter and digit prediction. The program lets you do cool things like downloading the EMNIST dataset, checking out dataset images, choosing models for training, and predicting handwritten letters/digits. After training a model on a dataset, you can simply load that model in and start drawing on the built in canvas to start predicting! We learnt how to use Python's  multithreading, box layouts, and utilised pytorch/torchvision package to train models like LeNet5 and MLP and test different datasets.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can grab the EMNIST dataset and dive into exploring the dataset images. Pick your favorite models and train them on the dataset, which are provided by the pytorch/torchvision package. The program lets you play around with parameters like the percentage of the dataset used for training, the number of epochs, batch size, and whether to use an MLP or LeNet model. You can customize the settings to fit your specific needs and see how different configurations affect the results.

          What’s more terrible than a trebuchet? One that launches marshmellows at you EVERY 20 seconds and obnoxiously beeps the tune of “never gonna give you up” if you don’t hit that snooze button! For the Terrible Ideas hackathon, we had to make something that was completely useless and terrible. In our intial brainstorm, we thought, how do we ensure students don’t fall asleep when they study? Our answer was simple - pain and destruction.           </p>
          <p>
          We literally sawed down a block of wood to create the base for the trebuchet. Then, we glued a servo motor to a 3D printed hinge, and wired the motor up to the Raspberry Pi. The hinge will rotate 90 degrees after 20 seconds if the button on the Raspberry Pi is not pressed, and will unhook the wire - thus launching the trebuchet.  Then, the Raspberry Pi is programmed to beep the tune of “Never Gonna Give You Up.” This hackathon was so much fun, but we definitely did not need to listen to Rick Astley for three solid hours.

        In this project, we undertake COMPSYS 301, a design course that requires us to form a four-person group to augment and program a two-wheeled robot. Our objective is to develop a robot capable of navigating a projected maze on the floor, using a ceiling-mounted projector. Throughout the project, we follow a design process involving continuous prototyping, testing, analysis, and refinement of our designs.
        </p>
        <p>
        In the analog design section, we designed the sensor and filter circuit. We prototyped the sensor, created truth tables, and ultimately transferred the final sensor layout to be manufactured on our own printed circuit board (PCB).        Shifting our perspective to the software design section, we implemented motor control, pathfinding algorithms, path tracking, and signal conditioning.
        </p>
        <p>
        This project is a culmilation of countless late nights in the lab with my teammates, losing our minds and picking over code! Sounds pretty horrible, but tackling a huge challenge with my teammate was actually so fun - we were sane because we had each other’s company. It wasn’t easy at all, but seeing the algorithm, sensor circuitry, and firmware all working together ……. it got me qutie emotional! I was so proud of our little robot for reaching the end of the maze.

      As users engage with the website, they experience an interplay between their actions and the dynamic formation of circles on the screen. By utilizing p5.js, I extracted the intensity of red values from each pixel in the webcam feed and translated it into corresponding circle sizes. Even in the absence of colors, the varying sizes of the circles come together, and form the same shape that the webcam sees. I loved doing this project and exploring the possibilities of creative coding.

      Flappy box is a Flappy Bird-inspired game designed for the DE0 console using digital logic and digital design methodologies. The game utilizes input devices such as the PS/2 mouse, DIP switches, and push buttons available on the DE0 board for control. VHDL programming language and software tools including Quartus and ModelSim were employed to configure the game's digital design and logic for the firmware.     
      </p>

      The game incorporates key game design elements, including limited lives, randomly generated pipe distances, memory storage for score keeping, power-ups providing temporary invisibility, and multiple difficulty levels. These features enhance the gameplay experience, offering challenges, progression, and strategic decision-making for players.

      This application enables users to view their own Pokémon collection. Users have the ability to select and manage their favourite Pokémon by adding or removing them from the favourites list. Additionally, users can access a list of their own favourite Pokémon as well as view favourites from other users. The project was developed as part of a 24-hour test for the SOFTENG 750 course, which required implementing API calls, the favouriting feature, and applying CSS styling to enhance the visual appeal.
      </p>
      <p>
      The website design drew inspiration from the iconic Pokedex concept, evoking nostalgia from Nintendo DS games such as Pokemon Black and White, HeartGold, Diamond/Pearl, and others. The chosen color palette reflected the distinct and contrasting colors associated with these Pokedexes, incorporating shades of yellow, green, red, and darker grey tones to maintain the Pokedex theme. The background design featured a grid pattern, reminiscent of the Unova Pokedexes. While the high-quality Pokémon images from the database contributed to a modern look, certain retro elements were preserved. This included the utilization of a sleek font and CSS animations, such as the spinning Pokeball on the login screen and sliding borders beneath each title. Throughout the design process, emphasis was placed on preserving the essence of the classic Pokemon aesthetic, thus retaining the bold and contrasting color scheme.
